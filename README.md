# Machine Learning for Embbedded Devices
sklearn2c is a tool that converts scikit-learn library classification algorithms to C code. It can be used to generate C code from trained models, which can then be used in microcontrollers or other embedded systems. The generated code can be used for real-time classification tasks, where the computational resources are limited.
